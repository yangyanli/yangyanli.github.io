I was a professor in Shandong University. Before that, I was a postdoctoral research fellow in Stanford University and Tel Aviv University, supervised by Prof. [Leonidas J. Guibas](https://geometry.stanford.edu/member/guibas/) and [Daniel Cohen-Or](https://danielcohenor.com/), respectively. I received my PhD degree from University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, supervised by Prof. [Baoquan Chen](https://baoquanchen.info/), and B.S. degree from Sichuan University.

My primary research interests fall in the field of Computer Graphics and Computer Vision, with an emphasis on 3D learning and vision. I have a series of papers accepted to top avenues such as SIGGRAPH (Asia), ICCV, NeurIPS, etc. ([recent publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9RxI7UAAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [most cited ones](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9RxI7UAAAAAJ&hl=en)).
